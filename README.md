# ✿ TermKaiwa – GUI Chat Application 💕

## Course Information

Course: CMPT 371 – Data Communications & Networking
Instructor: Mirza Zaeem Baig
Semester: Spring 2026

---

## Overview 🌸

TermKaiwa is a GUI-based chat application built using Python’s Socket API (TCP) with a light pink theme.
It allows multiple users to connect to a server and communicate in real time.

The system follows a client-server architecture and supports:

- Group chat 💬
- Direct messaging 💌
- Secret room with a shared password 🔒
- Username change ✨
- Mute specific users locally 🤫

---

## Features ✨

- Multiple clients can connect simultaneously 👥
- Real-time group chat 💬
- Private messaging using `/dm` 💌
- Username system (prevents duplicates) 🏷️
- Username change using `/rename` 🔄
- Join/leave notifications 🔔
- Online user list (`/users`) 👀
- Secret room with password (`/secret`, `/secret_leave`) 🔐
- Client-side mute (`/mute`, `/unmute`) 🤐
- Command system (`/help`, `/quit`) ❓
- Graphical User Interface using tkinter 🖥️

---

## Commands 📋

| Command                    | Description              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `/users`                   | Show all online users 👥 |
| `/rename <username>`       | Change your username 🔄  |
| `/dm <username> <message>` | Send a private message 💌 |
| `/secret <password>`       | Enter the secret room 🔒 |
| `/secret_leave`            | Leave the secret room 🚪 |
| `/mute <username>`         | Mute a user's messages 🤫 |
| `/unmute <username>`       | Unmute a user's messages 🔊 |
| `/help`                    | Show available commands ❓ |
| `/quit`                    | Leave the chat 👋       |

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- Python 3 🐍
- Socket API (TCP) 🔌
- Threading (for handling multiple clients concurrently) 🧵
- tkinter (for GUI) 🖼️

---

## Prerequisites 📋

- Python 3.10 or higher 🐍
- pip installed 📦

---

## Installation 🚀

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fleur0121/TermKaiwa.git
cd TermKaiwa
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Step-by-Step Run Guide 📖

### Start the server

```bash
python3 app/server.py
```

You will be prompted to set the secret room password.

### Start a client

Open another terminal and run:

```bash
python3 app/client.py
```

You can open multiple terminals to simulate multiple users.

---

## Example Usage 🌟

1. Start the server
2. Connect multiple clients
3. Enter a username
4. Send messages

Example:

```text
hello everyone
/dm Alice hi
/rename Fuka
/secret mypass
/secret_leave
/mute Alice
/users
```

## System Limitations & Design Considerations ⚠️

### Handling Multiple Clients

The server uses Python threading to handle multiple client connections.
Each client runs in a separate thread.

Limitation:
Thread-based design may not scale efficiently for a very large number of users.

---

### Client Disconnections

Disconnected clients are removed from the active list and other users are notified.

Limitation:
There is no automatic reconnection feature.

---

### Message Handling

The system uses TCP to ensure reliable message delivery.

Limitation:
Messages are stored only in memory for the current server session. When the
server restarts, history is lost.

History behavior:

- Public chat: new clients see the last 15 public messages on connect
- Secret room: clients see the last 15 secret messages upon entering
- Direct messages: `/dm <username>` shows the last 15 DMs with that user

---

### Security

Messages are transmitted without encryption.

Limitation:
This application is not secure for sensitive communication.
